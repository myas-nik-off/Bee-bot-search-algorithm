# Bee-bot-search-algorithm

Implementing DFS and A* search algorithms for the Bee bot to find the exit in a maze.


Task:

Determine the sequence of actions for Bee-bot to transition from its starting to its ending position. The Bee robot is equipped with four buttons: "Up" for moving forward, "Down" for moving backward, "Left" for a 90° left turn, and "Right" for a 90° right turn. By pressing these buttons in various sequences, you can map out a strategy for the robot to reach its target. After formulating their strategy, hitting the "Go" button activates the robot's movement.
